/**
 * Boot device shim ensures that DSM assigns a proper /dev/ device to our USB stick or SATA DOM
 *
 * WHY IS THIS NEEDED?
 * In short the DSM has multiple types of SCSI devices (boot device, USB drive, eSATA drive etc). The boot device is
 * always mounted to /dev/synoboot (with respective partitions at /dev/synobootN). The determination what to place there
 * is made based on different factors depending on the type of device used to boot (see drivers/scsi/sd.c):
 *  1) Standard USB stick
 *      - it has to be connected via a real USB port (i.e. not a fake-usb-over-sata like ESXi tries to do)
 *      - it must have VID/PID combo of 0xf400/0xf400
 *      - allows for normal boot when OS is installed, or triggers OS install/repair screen
 *  2) Force-install USB stick
 *      - it has to be connected via a real USB port
 *      - it must have VID/PID combo of 0xf401/0xf401
 *      - always triggers OS install/repair screen
 *  3) SATA DOM (Disk-on-Module)
 *      - kernel is compiled with SATA DOM support (NATIVE_SATA_DOM_SUPPORTED => CONFIG_SYNO_BOOT_SATA_DOM)
 *      - is a real SATA (i.e. not SCSI/iSCSI/VirtIO) device
 *      - has platform dependent vendor/model strings of CONFIG_SYNO_SATA_DOM_VENDOR/CONFIG_SYNO_SATA_DOM_MODEL
 *      - has platform dependent vendor/model strings of CONFIG_SYNO_SATA_DOM_VENDOR_SECOND_SRC/CONFIG_SYNO_SATA_DOM_MODEL_SECOND_SRC
 *      - SATA DOM *cannot* be used to force-reinstall (as there isn't an equivalent of USB's VID/PID of 0xf401/0xf401)
 *      - restrictions of native SATA-DOM are lifted by sata_port_shim.c and fake_sata_boot_shim.c
 *
 * There are other special ones (e.g. iSCSI) which aren't supported here. These only apply to small subset of platforms.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS?
 * Depending on the runtime configuration this shim will either engage USB-based shim or SATA-based one. See respective
 * implementations in shim/boot_dev/.
 *
 * References:
 *  - See drivers/scsi/sd.c in Linux sources (especially sd_probe() method)
