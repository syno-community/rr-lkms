/**
 * This tool is an isolated UART port-swapping utility allowing you to swap any two ports on runtime
 *
 * REASONING
 * Some kernels are compiled with CONFIG_SYNO_X86_SERIAL_PORT_SWAP set which effectively swaps first two serial ports.
 * This function reverses that. It also makes sure to move kernel console output between them (if configured).
 *
 *
 * OVERVIEW
 * Swapping the serials involves two things: swapping console drivers and swapping kernel console printk itself.
 * The first one can be done on any kernel by modifying exported "console_drivers". The second one requires an access
 * to either struct serial8250_ports (drivers/tty/serial/8250/8250_core.c) or to struct console_cmdline
 *  (kernel/printk/printk.c). Both of them are static so they're no-go directly.
 * Kernels before v4.1 had a convenient method update_console_cmdline(). Unfortunately this method was removed:
 * https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/c7cef0a84912cab3c9df8949b034e4aa62982ec9 so there's currently no method
 * of un-swapping on v4. Even worse calling this method on lower kernels is a combination of luck and timing (as this is
 * a init-only method).
 *
 *
 * IMPLEMENTATION
 * Things we've tried and failed:
 *  - Set the new console as preferred (making it default for /dev/console) -> /dev/ttyS0 and 1 are still wrong
 *  - Unregistering both ports and re-registering them -> we tried a bit and it's a nightmare to re-do and crashes the
 *    kernel
 *  - Unregistering and re-registering consoles -> will fail with KP or do nothing (and even if it worked if a
 *    non-console port is involved it will be broken)
 *  - Recreating the flow for serial8250_isa_init_ports() -> it appears to work (i.e. doesn't crash) but the serial port
 *    is dead afterwards and doesn't pass any traffic (we've never discovered why)
 *  => Hours wasted trying to reverse stupid ports: 37
 *  
 * What actually did work was carefully split-stopping the port (stopping the driver/hardware end of but not the higher
 * level ttyS# side), exchanging the iobase & IRQ (+ some other internal things generated during init), restarting the
 * port and hoping for the best. It does work BUT it's ridden with edge cases. Properly implementing and testing this
 * took ~3 full days and two people... so if you're not sure what you're doing here you can easily break it.
 *
 *
 * INTERNAL DETAILS
 * What we are doing here may not be intuitive if you don't exactly know how the 8250 driver works internally. Let's go
 * over this first. Each port is composed of outer uart_8250_port which contains various driver-specific information.
 * Inside it there's an uart_port struct which contains the information about the actual physical UART channel.
 *
 * When the ports were flipped their position in the internal 8250 list, their line# in uart_8250_port and other
 * internal properties were kept intact. The only two things which were changed are ->port.iobase and ->port.irq
 * Flipping these is enough to make port sort-of-working. The port will pass data BUT only if the other port triggers
 * interrupts (e.g. you type something on ttyS0 and nothing happens, you hold a space bar on ttyS1 afterwards and
 * stuff you've typed on ttyS0 starts appearing). This strange effect is caused by how 8250 driver implements IRQ
 * handling (serial8250_interrupt in 8250_core.c). It does not iterate over ALL ports looking for ports which match
 * the IRQ triggering the function. [FROM NOW ON READ CAREFULLY!] Instead, it uses and struct irq_info passed as
 * "user data" to the IRQ handler function. That struct contains a POINTER to a list_head of the first port, making
 * the irq_struct the list owner. That doubly-linked list ties together multiple uart_8250_port structures (->list)
 * which share the same IRQ. Here's the major problem: changing the NUMERIC IRQ value in uart_8250_port->port.irq
 * does nothing to the actual IRQ handling for that port.
 *
 * When an IRQ happens and serial8250_interrupt() fires, it looks at the irq_struct, gets the pointer to list_head
 * containing all active ports sharing a given IRQ and then just iterates over them triggering their internal
 * handling of stuff. The irq_struct list_head pointer is just a memory address and our swaps of anything will never
 * change it. This means two things: we need to fix the shared IRQ lists in uart_8250_port for ttyS0 and ttyS1 AND
 * fix the mapping of IRQ => uart_8250_port element. Keep in mind that uart_8250_port->list contains only the ports
 * which are currently active (i.e. enabled AND open). Kernel registers for IRQs only if something actually opens
 * the port (as there's no point to receive data where you don't place to deliver them).
 * 
 * Unfortunately, fixing these lists isn't really possible. The irq_struct contains a pointer to list_head which can
 * be in any of the uart_8250_port. If it points to ttyS0 and/or ttyS1 (spoiler: most likely yes, as they're open)
 * deleting an element from that list will break it completely (as irq_struct only knows the address of that one
 * uart_8250_port in practice). If we replace prev/next to point to a different port it will still break because
 * the interrupt handler calls container_of() which make prev/next irrelevant for the first fetch.
 * struct_irq is contained in two places: internally cached in the 8250_core.c and as a pointer in the kernel IRQ
 * handling. It will be unwise to try to modify it (ok, we're saying this only because we found a better way :D).
 *
 * Normally the IRQ manipulation is enabled/disabled by serial_link_irq_chain/serial_unlink_irq_chain in 8250_core.c
 * but they're static. However, we an exploit the fact that 8250 driver is modular and operations on the Linux port
 * are separated from operations on the hardware (which makes sense). We can command the UART chip to shutdown
 * before we touch iobase or irq (which naturally has to remove IRQ if present) and then command the chip to startup
 * which will register IRQ if needed (for the new irq value of course ;))

 *  directly, as only the TTY serial layer tracks that (drivers/tty/serial/serial_core.c).
 *
 * The trick here is that  We cannot check if the driver has the

 *  kernel has the IRQ handler registered for the given IRQ# *AND* if the port in question is part of the list for
 *  the IRQ. We can cheat here as we only need to know our own state. So in practice we need to just check if our
 *  list element (embedded list_head) is valid. See code for details.
 * While technically we CAN re-shutdown a port as many times as we want AS LONG AS it's not using the IRQ subsystem we
 *  shouldn't re-start a port which wasn't started before we tinkered with it! This is why we take care of IRQ and non-
 *  IRQ ports in the same. If you attempt to shutdown already shutdown port which is an IRQ one it will result in a
 *  kernel BUG() as the driver detects that something went wrong as it expects the IRQ to be running. If you do the
 *  same with timer-based port it will simply re-clear registries on the UART chip which will be a noop hardware-wise.
 *  This is because the 8250 and derivates cannot be really turned off once they start/reset. They can only be set in a
 *  way that they don't deliver interrupts for new data (and any new data will just override existing one). With timer-
 *  based port the kernel simply don't ask the chip if there's any data but the chip is still running. This is exactly
 *  why the 8250 driver will always attempt a read before "starting" the port and clear FIFOs on it.
